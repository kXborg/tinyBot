# 🧠 TinyBot

**TinyBot** is a minimal, text-based conversational model designed to mimic basic understanding and response behavior — similar to a chatbot, but with an ultra-light neural core.  

The project aims to learn how large language models work under the hood, by building a small and interpretable version from scratch.
